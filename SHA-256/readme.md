## How to use it

This is a C++ implementation of the SHA-256 hash function. To use it, clone the repository, navigate to ``cryptography/SHA-256`` in terminal, and enter 

``./hash "string"``

to hash your string. To hash multiple strings at once, separate them with commas:

``./hash "string1", "string2", "string3"``

**NOTE:** This program was compiled on a Mac. If you're not using MacOS you'll probably have to recompile the program yourself.
